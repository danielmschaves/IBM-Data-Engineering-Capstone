# IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate - Capstone Project
## Part 4: Data Warehouse Reporting with PostgreSQL

In this segment of the project, the objective was to generate reports from the previously designed data warehouse for an e-commerce company, SoftCart.com. The tasks undertaken are:

- Loading data into data warehouse tables: `DimDate`, `DimCategory`, `DimCountry`, and `FactSales`.
- Querying the data using various aggregation techniques like grouping sets, rollup, and cube.
- Creation of Materialized Query Tables (MQT) for optimized querying.

All the SQL scripts used to perform these tasks, along with sample data retrieval commands, are present in the accompanying SQL files in this repository.
