# IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate - Capstone Project
## Part 6: Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow

This part of the project involved creating a data pipeline using Apache Airflow. The pipeline was designed to process a web server log file, perform transformations on the data, and load the transformed data into a tar file.

The steps undertaken are:

- Define the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) arguments and the DAG itself.
- Create tasks to extract data from a web server log file, transform the data, and load the transformed data into a tar file.
- Define the task pipeline for the DAG.
- Save the DAG and submit it to Apache Airflow.
