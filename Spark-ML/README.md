# IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate - Capstone Project
## Part 7: Data Analysis with Apache Spark

This part of the project involved analyzing search terms on an e-commerce web server using Apache Spark. The tasks undertaken are:

- Installation and setup of Apache Spark.
- Loading of a CSV file containing search terms into a Spark DataFrame.
- Analysis of the DataFrame, including determining the shape, inspecting the top rows, and identifying the datatype of a specific column.
- Querying the DataFrame to count the number of times a specific search term ("gaming laptop") was used.
- Determination of the top 5 most frequently used search terms.
- Loading a pretrained sales forecasting model.
- Using the model to predict the sales for the year 2023.
