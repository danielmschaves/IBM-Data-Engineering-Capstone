# IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate - Capstone Project
## Part 3: Data Warehouse Design and Setup with PostgreSQL

In this part of the project, the task was to design and implement a data warehouse for an e-commerce company. The tasks completed in this part include:

- Designing a Star Schema for the warehouse by identifying the columns for the various dimension and fact tables in the schema.
- Creating dimension tables: `softcartDimDate`, `softcartDimCategory`, `softcartDimItem`, `softcartDimCountry`.
- Creating the fact table `softcartFactSales`.
- Designing the relationships amongst the tables.

The design of the database was done using the ERD design tool of pgAdmin and the schema was implemented in PostgreSQL. The SQL commands used to create the schema are included in this repository in the `create_schema.sql` file.
