# IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate - Capstone Project
## Part 1: Transactional Database Setup

This part of the project involves setting up a MySQL server and designing a schema for an OLTP database. The tasks completed in this part include:

- Creating a database named `sales`.
- Designing a `sales_data` table based on the sample data.
- Importing data from `oltpdata.csv` into `sales_data` table using phpMyAdmin.
- Listing the tables in the `sales` database.
- Writing a query to find out the count of records in the `sales_data` table.
- Creating an index named `ts` on the timestamp field.
- Listing indexes on the `sales_data` table.
- Writing a bash script named `datadump.sh` that exports all the rows in the `sales_data` table to a file named `sales_data.sql`.

The SQL and Bash scripts used to perform these tasks are included in this repository.
