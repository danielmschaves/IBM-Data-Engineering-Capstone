# IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate - Capstone Project
## Part 2: NoSQL Database Querying with MongoDB

This part of the project involves designing a data platform using MongoDB as a NoSQL database. This database was used to store the e-commerce catalog data. The tasks completed in this part include:

- Importing `catalog.json` into a MongoDB database named `catalog` and a collection named `electronics`.
- Listing all the databases.
- Listing all the collections in the `catalog` database.
- Creating an index on the field `type`.
- Writing a query to find the count of laptops.
- Writing a query to find the number of smartphones with a screen size of 6 inches.
- Writing a query to find the average screen size of smartphones.
- Exporting the fields `_id`, `type`, and `model` from the `electronics` collection into a file named `electronics.csv`.

The MongoDB commands used to perform these tasks are included in this repository in the `mongodb_commands.txt` file.
